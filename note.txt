*****************************Note on my approach**************************

1--> Used the CC_INDEX-2025-08 data for aus domains
2--> Used python script for extracting and storing in postgress
3--> Used DBT , -- created the staging layer and reporting layer. 
Extracting data from Staging layer applied tranformation and store it again to rpt layer.

4--> There is issue in extracting data using ABN api as it requires registring gov for issuing the dev api.

5--> We could have deployed the code at Databricks enginer , leverging its parallel execution and performance.(i did not had trail and paid edition)

6--> Not a fuuly optimized code and there are places to optimize it.
